The following automated actions were performed:

### 🔍 Diagnosis Results
- ✅ Confirmed initial build failure
- ✅ Identified compromised CRM integration components
- ✅ Located stable template replacements

### 🛠️ Repair Actions
- 🔄 Replaced CRM integration script with stable template
- 🔄 Updated Pricing component with enhanced CRM integration
- 🔄 Applied error handling and retry logic improvements
- ✅ Verified successful production build

### 📊 Validation Results
- ✅ Build process completed successfully
- ✅ All critical components restored
- ✅ Changes committed to repository

### 🚀 Next Steps
The standard deployment process should now trigger automatically. 

**Recommended:** Perform a manual end-to-end test to confirm full functionality.

            } else {
              body = `**🔧 Automated Repair Workflow Concluded** ⚠️

The workflow did not detect an initial build failure. The automated patch was skipped.

### 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Build process is currently functional
- ℹ️ No repair actions were necessary
- ✅ System appears to be in stable state

### 🔍 Recommendation
Please perform a manual review of the system state to confirm all components are functioning as expected.
